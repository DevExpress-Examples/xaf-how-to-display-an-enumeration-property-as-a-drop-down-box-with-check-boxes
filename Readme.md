# XAF - How to Display an Enumeration Property as a Check List

This example demonstrates how to create a custom Property Editor that displays an enumeration property as a check list. The enumeration type must be declared with a `FlagsAttribute` (allows to treat this enumeration as a set of flags).

> We created this example for demonstration purposes and it is not intended to address all possible usage scenarios with it.
> If this example does not have certain functionality or you want to change its behavior, you can extend this example as needed. Please note that this can be a complex task that requires good knowledge of XAF: [UI Customization Categories by Skill Level](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/application_framework/xaf-considerations-for-newcomers.xml#ui-customization-categories). You will likely need to research how our components work under the hood. Refer to the following help topic for more information: [Debug DevExpress .NET Source Code with PDB Symbols](https://docs.devexpress.com/GeneralInformation/403656/support-debug-troubleshooting/debug-controls-with-debug-symbols).

## Implementation Details

XAF does not have a built-in Property Editor for [enumeration properties](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113552/business-model-design-orm/data-types-supported-by-built-in-editors/enumeration-properties) that can store several values at once.  You need to implement a custom Property Editor that obtains the data property value and displays it in the UI with the help of a custom visual control. In an XAF Windows Forms application, the control is [`CheckedComboBoxEdit`](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraEditors.CheckedComboBoxEdit). In an XAF ASP.NET Core Blazor application, the control isÂ [DxListBox](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxListBox-2).
